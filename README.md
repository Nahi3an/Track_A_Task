# Track_A_Task

A company / employer who wants to track progress reports of their employees can use this software. First an account must be created by the manager who will assign tasks to the employee. While creating a managerial account, he must specify his company name and his designation ( manager / developer / QA ). For developers or employees, they also have to register under the same company name and then log in to their account.
